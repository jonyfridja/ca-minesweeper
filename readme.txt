improving ms
the numbers (i.e 20.5) represent dates
features: 
	add some animated sprites
	mb even make the entire game buttons from sprites
20.5.19
	animation on bomb clocked
	change the implementation of model initialization a bit
		after implementing, before checking - I think my older solution works faster (shuffling and popping)
